# 🎶 Audio Semaphore – STM32 Project

**Audio Semaphore** is an **embedded systems project** developed in **STM32CubeIDE** with an **STM32F767ZITX** microcontroller.  
Its purpose is to serve as an **inclusive tool for people with autism or noise sensitivity**.  

In environments such as classrooms, when noise levels become too high, the system emits an audio alert so the teacher is aware that it is time to restore order.  
This helps create a more comfortable and accessible environment for students sensitive to noise.
